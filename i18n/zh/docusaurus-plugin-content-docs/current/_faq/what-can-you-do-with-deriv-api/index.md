The Deriv API allows you to perform nearly all functions of the Deriv platforms, since
they share the same API. For our CFD platforms (Deriv MT5 and Deriv X), the API
functionality is only available for some account management actions.

Our API users typically perform the following activities:

- Build websites similar to Deriv but with different features.
- Create desktop apps to execute trades for themselves and their clients.
- Explore historical tick information.
- Automate services as payment agents.
