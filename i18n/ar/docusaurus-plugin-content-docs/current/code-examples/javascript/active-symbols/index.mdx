import SandboxIframe from '@site/src/components/SandboxIframe';
import { sandboxes } from '@site/src/components/SandboxIframe/utility/sandboxes';

Retrieve a list of all currently active symbols (underlying markets upon which contracts are available for trading).

<SandboxIframe sandbox={sandboxes.active_symbols} />

The data contains market and submarket information related to the symbol. In case you want to retrieve active symbols for a specific landing company, you can add landing_company to the request object.
