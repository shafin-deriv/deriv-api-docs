- You can earn commission on trades and payments your clients perform via
  the websites and apps you create with Deriv API. Get more details about the
  commission plans [here](https://deriv.com/partners/affiliate-ib).

- You can also earn from markups on every contract purchased via a trading
  app you created with Deriv API. The markup is defined by you and can be up
  to 5%.

Here is an example of how the markup is calculated:

- To get a payout of 2 **USD** : Client stake without markup = 1.07 **USD**
- With the markup (e.g. 2%), a client pays : Client's stake with the markup =
  Stake + (payout x markup)
- Client's stake with the markup = 1.07 **USD** + (2 **USD** x 2%) = 1.11 **USD**
